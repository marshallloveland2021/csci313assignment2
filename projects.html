              <p>
                CSCI 366 was a class all about database systems. We first
                learned how to model different database designs with Crows Foot
                Notation. We also learned how to use SQL query language. When we
                understood everything we need to implement a database we had to
                come up with a project. My partners and I came up with a library
                system that would would ask to create users, books, and
                libraries. When you add the books you could check them out to
                different users created. This was completed using PostgreSQL and
                Java.

              <h3>MATH 266 Projects</h3>
              <p>
                MATH 266 was an introduction to differential equations. This
                class had us solve first and second order differential
                equations. We did two different projects in this class that
                would have us solve real world problems using differential
                equations. The first project my partners and I solved disease
                growth. The second project we used a 2nd order differential
                equation to solve an RCL circuit. The projects required us to
                solve the equation and figure out the equilibrium solution. We
                needed to also find the particular solution.
